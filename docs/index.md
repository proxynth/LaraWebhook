## Quick Example

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::post('/stripe-webhook', function () {
    $payload = json_decode(request()->getContent(), true);
    
    // Handle the event
    event(new StripeWebhookReceived($payload));
    
    return response()->json(['status' => 'success']);
})->middleware('validate-webhook:stripe');
```

**What the middleware does automatically:**
- ✅ Validates the webhook signature
- ✅ Logs the event to the database
- ✅ Rejects duplicate webhooks (idempotency)
- ✅ Dispatches collected domain events through the Laravel adapter
- ✅ Returns 403 for invalid signatures
- ✅ Returns 400 for malformed payloads
